# Etch A Sketch
This is a HTML, CSS and JavaScript recreation of the iconic etch a sketch toy which was released in 1960.

## Purpose Of This Project
I undertook this project to practice using the DOM at a higher level than in my rock paper scissors project.

## How To Access & Use
You can see how this project looks and functions by visiting this [link](https://v-imv.github.io/etch-a-sketch/) or by clicking on the page link under the "About" section on the right hand side of the screen.

Once you open the page you will see a square in which you will be able to draw.

To actually start drawing you must click the "New Grid" button and input a number between 1 and 100 inclusive.

Note: You will be continuously prompted until you input a valid number.

Once you input a valid number you can hover your mouse over the square and your cursor will be 'drawing'.

If you would like to reset the grid or use a different size you can simply click the "New Grid" button and input a valid number again.

## What I Learned/Gained From This Project
- Exposure to different event listeners
- The ability to change/update page content dynamically with the DOM
- The ability to use flexbox at a more advanced level than before
